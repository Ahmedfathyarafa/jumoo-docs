title: uSync.Once / Stop files
---

`uSync.Once` and `uSync.stop` are special files that you can use on your deployments to control how uSync imports are ran at startup.

If you site has the `ImportAtStartup` setting configured to import items when the site starts up then the once and stop files will be checked. 

### uSync.Once 
If your uSync folder (`uSync/v9`) contains a `usync.once` file, then uSync will perform an import at startup and then rename the usync.once file into a usync.stop file. 

### uSync.Stop

if during startup the uSync folder contains a `usync.stop` file then uSync will not perform an import even if the ImportAtStartup setting is true


## One time import 
The main purpose of the usync.once and usync.stop files are to allow you to perform a one time import when you deploy your site, but then not have an import run should your site restart without deployment. 

1. write a usync.once file to the site on deployment 
2. when the site starts up uSync will perofrm and import and rename usync.once to usync.stop
3. if the site restarts or reloads without a deployment the usync.stop file will prevent imports from happening.
